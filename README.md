# Professional Portfolio

## Description

My very first attempt at Full Design and Development of a Professional Portfolio page (virtual resume)!

  - Researched and wireframed a one-page professional developer website
  - Created a logo, updated my resume and decided on my brand identity (typography, colors and photos/icons)
  - Starting with just the basic HTML5 Boilerplate coded each piece of HTML & CSS on my own utilizing the lessons/knowledge from the first modules in the UCF Coding Bootcamp Program
  - Added in Navigation Links and Social Media Links as well as a Button to my updated Resume
  
## Insltallation

Currently only published through Github but will continue to update and enhance with new skills and projects/applications developed throughout the bootcamp
  
  - Purchased domain: PattyManecci.com and will host and publish my final Developer Portfolio there
  - Will continue to improve and add features and projects to this portfolio throughout the UCF Coding Bootcamp
  
## Usage
  
Purpose of site is to provide potential employers a one-stop site to view my work and resume when looking for a Full-Time job in Web Development
